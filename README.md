# glass-effect-login-form

The provided code is an HTML document containing a login form styled with CSS to create a glass effect.


The CSS styles create a glass effect for the login form by using rgba() color values for the background with some opacity, applying a backdrop filter to blur the background, adding padding, border radius, and box shadow to the form container, and styling the input fields and submit button.

Additionally, there's a JavaScript function login(event) referenced in the form's onsubmit attribute, but the implementation of this function is not provided in the code snippet.
